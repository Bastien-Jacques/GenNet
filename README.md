GenNet is a deep learning framework for predicting the aerodynamic drag coefficient of vehicle shapes and reconstructing their Signed Distance Functions (SDF). This enables the generation of new car geometries optimized for aerodynamic performance. GenNet is based on an autoencoder structure. The model has been trained on the DrivAerNet++ Dataset (train set). This repository contains the source code, analysis notebooks, and scripts to train and evaluate the model.
